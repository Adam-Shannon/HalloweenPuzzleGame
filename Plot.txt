To generate the images, we first need to create a plot to base them of.

We should have several rooms (~5) with a secret code/specific action that’s needed to progress to the next room.

PLOT:

We start in a haunted house…












Ideas:
- A killer/monster character
- Certain careless actions will cause GAME OVER
- Different types of puzzles: combination locks, pattern recognitions, simple logic puzzles, audio queues, puzzle with a barcode
