Escape room puzzle game using AI generated art
- if possible slight changes in image each time you play the game
-- some restriction on what we can generate
- Halloween/horror theme

Issues:
- Generating AI images 
- Pygame to create a shell of the game 
- Creative elements - invent a story  


new ideas:
- add a timer (escape rooms have a timer, let's say the monster/killer kills the player when time runs out)
- add a hint system? (if a user is not sure what to do, offer him a possible action he could take)
if we are struggling to determine when a player makes a "bad" action, we can just use a predetermined list of actions
- can we add music/soundtrack/sound effects?
- text to speech/ or record voice for predetermined story lines
- inventory for picking up items?
